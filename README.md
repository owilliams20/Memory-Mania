2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[Challange 1 the blocks had no initial color, Challenge 2 Start/Stop button didn't work, Challenge 3 in function playClueSequene I accedentially
typed in o instead of 0 so my game didn't work, Challenge 4 buttons didn't light up during clues]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[how to make a website like glitch, user interface, just easy]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[not a lot of time at all, home page, more features... ]
