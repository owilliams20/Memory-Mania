## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.

* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[I use the links in the instructions to help with my color and font selections (I added them below)]
https://www.rapidtables.com/web/css/css-color.html#green 
https://www.w3schools.com/css//css_font_websafe.asp 

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[The first challenge that I ran into while coding this game was that initially none of the buttons had any color. 
I was really worried when I noticed it, but continued coding because I tought maybe something else would activate the color. 
Then when I finished and noticed there was still no initial color I went back and  compared my code to the code in the directions 
and that's when I found out that I had a colon after the first #button1 and because I used #button1 to code the rest of the buttons 
the rest of the  buttons had the colon as well once I deleted it the color worked. The second challenge I face  is that the start stop 
button didn't work for some reason when I pressed the start button the start button hid and the stop button 
showed like it was supposed to. But when I would hit the stop button and the start button didn't show up again. Similar to my first 
challenge I looked very carefully at the code in the instructions and compared it to my own and I wasn't able to see any mistakes,but 
I knew that the start button did work so I copied the code from that function and pasted it where the stock function would be and I swap the 
original values for the ones that applied to the stop button and that made it work. The last challenge that I faced was that is the function playClueSequence 
didn't initially work and after looking back at my code I realized that I accidentally typed a lowercase "o" instead of a zero and once I corrected 
that mistake my code my game worked perfectly.


3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[While I was making this game it really stood out to me how nice of a website glitches and I was really thinking about What it takes to make a website one
like this because it not only lets you code it lets you design an interface as well. I've always been really interested in the user experience and kind of 
what the user sees and I feel like looking at glitters website really embodies what  I'm interested in.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had a few more hours I definitely would've added in a randomizing function so that the game with generate a random sequence every time.
I also would've tried to attempt more of the optional aspects of the game I think that's something that I could've done had I had the time 
and did a little more research. I think I also would've done some research on whether or not this website had the capacity to add a second screen 
to the game and if I found out that it did I would've looked into trying to add a Home screen for the game.]
